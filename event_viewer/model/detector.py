"""
Detector geometry for drawing: silicon pad planes and tungsten absorber blocks.

``DetectorModel`` turns the existing geometry pieces -- :class:`DetectorGeometry`
(layer z positions), :class:`PadMap` (chip/channel -> x,y) and the
``slab_z_positions.yml`` (z and W thickness per slab) -- into the numbers the
visualisers need:

* ``slab_z_array`` : per-hit z from the hit's slab index.
* ``pads_for_slab``: the (x, y) centres of every pad in a layer (grey grid).
* ``wafer_rects``  : the active area of each silicon sensor in a layer.
* ``silicon_quads``/``tungsten_boxes``: corner coordinates for the 3-D Mesh3d
  representation of each Si plane and W plate.

A layer is not a continuous silicon plane: it is an array of silicon sensors,
each carrying 16x16 pads with an inactive 0.61 mm rim around them, so the
boundary between two butted sensors is a 1.22 mm dead cross. ``wafer_rects``
recovers that segmentation from the pad map itself -- no wafer count or gap
width is hardcoded here -- so the drawn geometry follows whatever mapping file
the run uses. The rectangle it returns is the sensor's *active* area, which is
what the outlines in the 2-D view are for: what falls between two of them is
exactly the dead region, where no hit can appear.

The pad map is written on the same grid as the simulated geometry (see
mappings/regenerate_pad_maps.py), so nothing here has to correct for a
difference between the two.

The class owns no plotting code; it only produces geometry arrays.
