"""
Interactive event viewer for the SiW-ECAL simulation.

A self-contained OOP package (read with ``uproot``, drawn with Plotly Dash) to
inspect reconstructed ``ecal`` events one by one, explore file-level distributions
with dynamic cuts, and run simple clustering on per-event variables.

All physics and geometry code this viewer needs is bundled as private ``_``
modules inside this package, so it can run independently without installing or
importing any other siwecal package.
