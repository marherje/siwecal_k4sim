# SiW-ECAL Event Viewer

Interactive Plotly Dash app to inspect reconstructed `ecal` events: a 3-D
detector scene (silicon planes + tungsten absorbers) with the per-pad signals
coloured by energy, a 2-D per-layer view, a lateral table of per-event metrics,
plus a distributions tab with dynamic cuts and simple clustering.

## Load the environment

One-time setup (once per machine/account):

```bash
source init_siwecal_soft.sh   # load key4hep first
bash setup_venv.sh            # creates .venv-viewer in the repo root
```

The `.venv-viewer` is a `--system-site-packages` venv on top of key4hep (which
already provides uproot, pandas, scikit-learn, ...) with only `dash` + `plotly`
added. It is **not** versioned (147 MB, with absolute CVMFS paths baked in).

After that, source the environment before each session:

```bash
source init_siwecal_soft.sh
```

## Run

From the **repo root**:

```bash
python -m event_viewer                                   # pick a file from the dropdown
python -m event_viewer --file /path/to/ecal_run.valcache.root   # open one directly
python -m event_viewer --data-dir /some/other/dir        # scan a custom directory
```

Then open the UI from your laptop through an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 8050:localhost:8050 you@lxplus.cern.ch
# browse to http://localhost:8050
```

Without `--file` the viewer scans every `data_dir` configured in `settings.yml`
(plus `cache_dir` if set) for `*.valcache.root` and `ecal_*.root` — the latter
also matches the `k4SiWEcalReco` outputs `ecal_<run>.edm4hep.root` /
`ecal_<run>.valtree.root`, read automatically with the right reader. Pick a run
from the dropdown or change file at runtime.

## Tabs

- **Event** — 3-D scene + 2-D layer grid + metrics table. Navigate with the
  *Previous*/*Next* buttons or by typing an index. Only events passing the active
  cuts are reachable.
- **Distributions** — file-level histograms; add **dynamic cuts** by picking
  variables (a `RangeSlider` appears per variable) which also filter the Event
  tab; run **clustering** (K-Means / DBSCAN / GMM / Spectral) on chosen features
  and view the labels on any 2-variable scatter.

## Files without metrics

Opening a plain `ecal_*.root` (no `.valcache.root`) still works: the viewer
computes only the cheap derivable quantities (`nhit`, `sum_energy`,
`n_layers_hit`, `first/last_layer`, `zbary`, `mip_likeness`, `e_over_nhit`) and
the status bar flags the file as "SIN métricas". The event and layer views are
unaffected.

## MIP cut (hit-energy threshold)

The Event tab has a **MIP cut** slider (`hit_energy ≥ 0 / 0.5 / 1.0 MIP`) that
filters hits below the threshold and recomputes the per-event metrics
accordingly.

- **Files with the metrics tree** carry pre-computed branches (`mip05_*`,
  `mip1_*`) written by `k4SiWEcalReco` in `--validation` mode, so changing the
  cut is an instant branch read.
- **Plain `ecal_*.root` files** have no such branches, so the slider falls back
  to an in-memory recompute that loops over every event in Python. This is fine
  for small files but prohibitively slow on large runs.

To avoid the viewer hanging, the MIP cut slider is **disabled** when a file both
(1) lacks pre-computed MIP branches **and** (2) has more than
`max_recompute_events` events (default **10000**). The status bar then notes
*"MIP cut disabled"*. Generate a metrics file with the pre-computed MIP branches
(`python k4SiWEcalReco/run_pid_batch.py --validation`) to re-enable the cut on
large files.

The limit is configurable:

```bash
python -m event_viewer --max-recompute-events 50000   # raise (or lower) the cap
```

or set `max_recompute_events` on `ViewerConfig`.

## Architecture (OOP)

```
config.py        ViewerConfig (paths, display constants)
io/              EventFileReader            — uproot, per-event vs per-hit split
model/           DetectorModel, Event, EventDataset
analysis/        CutModel, ClusteringService, compute_cheap_metrics (reuses metrics.py)
viz/             DetectorScene3D, LayerGrid2D, DistributionPlots — Plotly figures
controller.py    ViewerController           — geometry + builders + per-file cache
ui/              build_layout, register_callbacks — Dash
app.py           build_app factory; __main__.py CLI
```

All geometry and physics code is bundled as private `_` modules inside this
package; reads with uproot (no PyROOT needed).

## Troubleshooting

- **Distributions / clustering "stuck" on a previous selection.** A clustering
  run is tied to the cuts it was computed under; changing the cuts invalidates it
  (the histogram, scatter and cluster examples then follow the current selection
  again). Just re-run clustering after changing cuts.
- **The UI occasionally gets into an inconsistent state** after a particular
  clustering ↔ cuts ↔ event-navigation sequence (a Dash client/server state race
  we could not reproduce deterministically). If a panel looks out of sync,
  **refresh the browser tab** (or restart `python -m event_viewer`) — that always
  resolves it. State is rebuilt from the files, so nothing is lost.
